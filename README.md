# odin-recipes

This project is part of The Odin Project Foundations course.

The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website using HTML.

Skills demonstrated in this project:
-Creating HTML boilerplate
-Working with headings, paragraphs, and lists
-Creating links between pages
-Organizing files and folders
-Using Git and GitHub for version control

Ive already gained some experience with freecodingcampg, so this project was great help for me to work with Git and GitHub. I hope in the future i can look back to here.
